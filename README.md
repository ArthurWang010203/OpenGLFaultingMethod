# Terrain Generation with Faulting Method

This project is a C++ application that generates terrain using the faulting method, renders it in an OpenGL window with interactive camera controls and lighting, and allows users to export the terrain to a `.obj` 3D model file.

## Features

- **Terrain Generation**: Generate realistic terrain using the faulting method.
- **Rendering**: Real-time rendering using OpenGL.
- **Camera Controls**: Interactive camera with movement controls.
- **Lighting**: Basic lighting to enhance visual realism.
- **Export**: Export the generated terrain to a `.obj` file for use in other applications.

## Controls

- WASD & QE to pan
- Mouse move to look around
- Scroll to zoom
- R to regenerate (new) terrain
- X to export to file "terrain_meshWidth_meshHeight.obj"
